# Elasticsearch-query-builder

In this [Tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/elasticsearch-query-body-builder-node-js/), we have made use of the elastic builder library, https://elastic-builder.js.org/. This library has been used to build our queries for search, instead of relying on raw elastic search queries.
